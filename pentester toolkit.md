Port Scanner Module: The port_scanner function scans specified ports on a target host and prints whether each port is open or closed.

Brute-Force Module: The brute_force_login function performs a brute-force attack on a login page using a given wordlist. It tries each password from the wordlist and prints whether the login was successful.

Main Script: The main function integrates the port scanner and brute-force modules. It specifies the target host, ports to scan, wordlist file, login URL, and form field names. It then runs the port scanner and brute-force attack in sequence.
